    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>As someone with a diverse background and a proven track record of success in various fields, I am now embarking on a new chapter in my career by pursuing my passion for web development. <br> With a keen interest in learning new things and a drive to excel, I am excited to leverage my unique combination of skills and experiences in this dynamic field.

       <br> My journey so far has been marked by a wide range of accomplishments. As a CEO of GO HUS, a producer and reseller of tiny/modular houses, I have successfully managed all aspects of the business, from recruiting and leading teams to driving sales and building strong partnerships in the business and private sectors. <br> Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, I have overseen a remarkable increase in house sales from 10 per year to an impressive 40-50 per year, showcasing my ability to adapt and thrive in changing markets. <br>
        
        In addition to my entrepreneurial ventures, I have also been the CEO of ICE Wellness, an innovative online company in the sports therapy and wellness industry. Drawing on my fast thinking and execution skills, I have designed and established a successful online business, importing products from China and creating a unique brand in the market.
        
        My diverse background extends beyond the business world. With a bachelor's degree in law and previous work experience in law enforcement, including tackling illegal immigration and crimes, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to work under pressure. I have also been part of an investigation unit within the Swedish police authorities, where attention to detail and critical thinking were essential.
        
        Beyond my professional achievements, I am an individual who loves to travel and explore new cultures with my family. As a homeowner, I have also honed my hands-on skills in building and renovation, showcasing my ability to be both creative and practical.
        
        Furthermore, my passion for web development stems from my lifelong interest in computers since I was a kid. I am highly motivated and disciplined, with a competitive spirit fostered through my sports background in track and field, where I was known as one of the most promising and fastest athletes in short distances.
        
        As I embark on my journey in web development, I am excited to bring my diverse skill set, entrepreneurial mindset, fast thinking, and proven track record of success to create meaningful and impactful projects. I am confident that my ability to adapt, think critically, and execute efficiently, combined with my passion for learning and exploring new opportunities, make me a strong candidate for a career in web development.</p>
